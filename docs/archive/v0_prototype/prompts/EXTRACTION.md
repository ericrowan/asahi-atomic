# 🛑 PROTOCOL: TOTAL RECALL (DEEP EXTRACTION)

**Context:** We are archiving this session state to a persistent Knowledge Base. I require a complete, lossless dump of all critical data, decisions, and creative assets generated in this thread.

**Your Role:** Archivist & Data Miner.

**THE DIRECTIVE:**
Do not summarize. Do not "yada yada." If a list has 20 items, list all 20. If a code snippet was 50 lines, provide all 50.

**DATA TO EXTRACT:**
1.  **The Hard Assets:**
    *   All specific names, titles, and codenames discussed (Accepted AND Rejected).
    *   All Hex codes, color palettes, and visual style definitions.
    *   All specific copy/text written for UI, READMEs, or Scripts.
2.  **The Logic:**
    *   Why did we make specific decisions? (The "Why").
    *   What constraints did we identify?
3.  **The "Unknowns":**
    *   Scan your context window for details I may have forgotten to ask about. If it seems relevant to the project's future, dump it here.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
*   Use Markdown code blocks for raw data.
*   Use clear headers.
*   **Loop Clause:** If you hit a token limit or cut off, stop exactly where you are. Do not try to rush the ending. I will type "CONTINUE" to get the rest.

**Begin.**
