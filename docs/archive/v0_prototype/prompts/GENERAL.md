## 1. The Onboarding Protocol (New Model Start)
> "I am working on WavyOS (Project Mycelium Phase 3). Read `docs/knowledge-base/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` and `docs/knowledge-base/STYLE_GUIDE.md`. This is your memory. We are currently in the [INSERT PHASE] phase. Acknowledge and await instructions."

## 2. The "Unstuck" Protocol (When spinning wheels)
> "STOP. We are looping. Review the last 3 turns. Identify the root cause of the friction (e.g., Syntax Error, Architecture Mismatch, Hallucination). Propose ONE surgical fix to resolve it. Do not generate code until I approve the fix."

## 3. The "Tuner" (Refining Output)
> "Refine the last response. Apply the following filters:
> 1. **Precision:** Remove fluff.
> 2. **Scientific:** Use exact terminology (e.g., 'Ostree Commit' not 'Update').
> 3. **Esoteric:** Align with the 'Wavy' aesthetic (Flow, Resonance) without breaking professionalism."

## 4. The Deep Extraction (Total Recall)
> [Insert the "Universal Extraction Protocol" text here]
