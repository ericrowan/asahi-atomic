## 📝 Raw User Instructions (2023-11-05)
"Okay, so I need to get the atomic CLI working on ARM64. Let me think... First, I remember that the build system had some issues with cross-compilation. Oh right, the last time we tried this, the tests failed on the ARM64 emulator. So I need to make sure that the build process is correctly configured for ARM64. Also, the documentation needs updating - there's a section in the README about supported architectures that's outdated. And I should write unit tests specifically for the ARM64 port. Wait, did we already have some tests for this? Maybe not comprehensive enough. Oh, and the Homebrew formula might need adjustments too. Let me check the GitHub Actions workflow... Hmm, the current matrix doesn't include ARM64. I'll need to add that. Also, the Flatpak manifest might require changes for the new architecture. This is going to take some time, but let's break it down into manageable tasks..."
