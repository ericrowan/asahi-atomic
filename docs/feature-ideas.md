# Feature Ideas
Features to implement in the Asahi Atomic operating system.

### User Setup (first boot
- Disable Location Services by default
- What about Enable Third-Party Repositories? (in the past, enabling this here has crashed the wizard)

### macOS-like Behavior
- Dash to Dock w/curated config applied 
- Blur My Shell w/curated config applied 
- Keybindings: maybe we leave it as default (see @marcan42's response: https://www.reddit.com/r/AsahiLinux/comments/1c25vsl/simple_guide_how_to_make_the_asahi_linux/)

### Zed vs VC Codium
- I personally prefer Zed and hope others will, too
- That said, IDE/Code Editors are very personal 
- I think we should configure Zed to use Adwaita fonts (mono for code, sans for UI) sie 14px for code and 15px for UI

### System Settings
**(Display)**
- I have my display scale set to 150% and this works for me
- Do research: is this the best option for everyone?
- Display Scaling: Research and implement the best display scaling option for everyone
(**3-finger drag**)
- One of my favorite settings in macOS and one I'm not sure why isn't set by default
- Here's a github repo: https://github.com/lmr97/linux-3-finger-drag

### Asahi-Atomic Agent (will need new name)
- Ollama running lightweight model like Qwen or Mistral
- Possibly running in a more lightweight Distrobox container like Alpine Linux? 
- Guard: Ensure we are running on the Host
    if [ -f /run/.containerenv ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: This script controls the Hypervisor and Disk Images."
    echo "Please run 'just test' from your HOST terminal, not inside a Distrobox."
    exit 1
    fi
- Auto-launch upon boot/startup; can be disabled
- Acts as a helpdesk chatbot for users
- Acts as a personal assistant for users
- Helps run commands
- Provides system information and diagnostics
- Model can easily be swapped out by user
- Runs directly in terminal and is available by invoking the command
- Will need a fun/friendly name that fits our branding with WavyOS: "WavyAI" or "VibesAI" 
- Other naming ideas: "WavyGPT", "VibesGPT", "WavyChat", "VibesChat", "WavyBot", "VibesBot"
- Could be a spoof of Miscrosoft's Clippy
- Or could keep it very simple: "chat" to invoke and then the actual name is printed as "WavyAI chat here! What can I do for you?"

### Tweaks app
- Focus Follows Mouse enabled 
- Raise Windows When Focused enabled

### Post-login
- Enable automatic updates
- Enable automatic backups
- Enable automatic system cleanup
- Auto-launch Asahi Atomic Assistant (for Gnome/Atomic help)
