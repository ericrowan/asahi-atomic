# asahi-atomic

**The chill, bulletproof way to run Fedora Atomic on Apple Silicon.**

  > **STATUS: UNDER CONSTRUCTION.** This project is currently in active development. Do not use unless you are comfortable breaking things.

## What is this?

A custom OS image that brings the power of Fedora Silverblue to M1/M2 MacBooks. It takes the hard work out of setting up an immutable system on Apple hardware.

## The Vibe

  - Unbreakable: Updates are atomic. If it breaks, roll back.
  - Clean: No package bloat.
  - Ready: Audio and UI fixes baked in.

## Installation

**Coming soon.**

We are currently finalizing the build pipeline. The goal is a simple script that takes over an existing Asahi partition and replaces it with this image.

## Philosophy

We believe the OS should be a factory-sealed engine, and your apps should be accessories. We use Flatpaks for apps and Containers for dev tools.

## Disclaimer

This is a community project, not official Asahi software. It involves disk partitioning. Backup your data.
